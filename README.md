# Memory Game

The **Memory Game** project is a game that can help you to train your memory.

## 📜 Game's Rules

Click on two of the cards to see the color they contain :

- If the colors of the two cards are identical, you have found a pair and you score 1 point
- If the colors of the cards do not match, you do not score any points. The cards are turned face down again and you can play again.

The game ends once all pairs have been found.
